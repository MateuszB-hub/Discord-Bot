# Discord-Bot
Discord Bot for my Server to moderate chat and interacts with users through command input

There are multiple commands that are for any user but some of them do require permissions or do not allow certain actions
An example of this is the kick command cannot kick the server owner (Mattican)

There are modules here like the weather-js and urban (urban dictionary) that I had to not include since 
I do not want the api keys to be revealed.

This passion project is still a work in progress and I will continue to add onto it in the future

Some of the command files have been excluded for privacy reasons.

In addition, node modules, config.json, package.json are excluded as well for the previous reasons stated
